## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- ES6 features

### What I learned

aria-live="polite" indicates that the screen reader should wait until the user is idle before presenting updates to the user.


```html
<span class="error" aria-live="polite">  </span>
```
### Continued development

- Will want to work more on forms since there are multiple ways in writing the logic. 
- Definitely would want to try more ofthe ES6 features üòÅ

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-form-validation-by-making-a-form/) - This helped me to understand client side form validation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand client side form validation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
